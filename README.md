# Hello Swing

## Due: DoW MM/DD at 11:59 PM

- Open the file `HelloSwing.java`
- Familiarize yourself with the different parts of creating a GUI
- Change the text for the existing label to say "Counter: " instead of "Number of button clicks: "
- Change the label for the existing button to say "Increment"
- Create a second button with the label "Decrement" that decrements the counter and updates the label when clicked
- Create a second label that says "ON"
- Create a third button with the label "Toggle" that changes the second label to "OFF" if it is "ON" and "ON" if is "OFF"
